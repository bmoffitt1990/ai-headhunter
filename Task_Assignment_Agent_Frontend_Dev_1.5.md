# APM Task Assignment: PDF Export System

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the AI Headhunter project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent specializing in frontend development and PDF generation, your core function is to create a sophisticated PDF export system that converts the HTML resume templates into high-quality, professional PDF documents. You will build the critical bridge between the visual resume templates and the final downloadable documents that users will submit to employers.

**Workflow:** You interact directly with the User, who acts as the communication bridge with the Manager Agent. You will report your progress, results, or any issues back to the User, who relays updates to the Manager Agent for review and coordination.

**Memory Bank:** You must log your activities, outputs, and results to the designated Memory Bank file (`Memory/Phase_1_Foundation/Task_1.5_PDF_Export_Log.md`) upon completing tasks or reaching significant milestones, following the standard logging format.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

**Prerequisite Work Completed:** Previous agents have successfully completed foundational infrastructure:

- **Task 1.1 (Agent_Setup_Specialist):** Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components installed and configured, Supabase client configuration established
- **Task 1.2 (Agent_Frontend_Dev):** Resume data input system with TypeScript interfaces, Zod validation schemas, and react-hook-form integration including PersonalInfo, Experience, Education, Skills, and Projects interfaces
- **Task 1.3 (Agent_Auth_Dev):** Authentication system with Supabase Auth, login/signup pages, route protection, and user session management
- **Task 1.4 (Agent_Frontend_Dev):** HTML resume rendering engine with professional templates, real-time preview, print-optimized styling, and template switching functionality

**Available Infrastructure:**
- Complete resume rendering system with multiple professional templates (Professional, Modern, Minimal)
- Print-optimized HTML/CSS with proper page break handling and typography
- Real-time preview components with template switching and customization
- Responsive template components for all resume sections (PersonalInfo, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects)
- Template system architecture with theming and font customization
- TypeScript interfaces for ResumeData and template system
- Supabase authentication with protected routes

**How This Task Integrates:** You will create the PDF generation system that converts the polished HTML output from Task 1.4 into downloadable PDF documents. This system will be integrated with Task 1.6 (Data Persistence) for resume storage and Task 1.7 (UI Design Implementation) for seamless user interface integration.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1, Task 1.5 - Agent_Frontend_Dev: PDF Export System` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Create a robust PDF export system that converts HTML resume templates into high-quality, professional PDF documents with customizable formatting options, efficient generation, and seamless download functionality.

## 4. Detailed Action Steps

   - Create PDF generation service: `src/lib/pdf/generator.ts` with configurable backends
   - Implement fallback strategy (client-side backup if server-side fails)

2. **Create PDF generation API endpoint**
   - Build Next.js API route: `src/app/api/generate-pdf/route.ts`:
     ```typescript
     export async function POST(request: Request) {
       const { htmlContent, options } = await request.json()
       // PDF generation logic
       return new Response(pdfBuffer, {
         headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'application/pdf',
           'Content-Disposition': 'attachment; filename="resume.pdf"'
         }
       })
     }
     ```
