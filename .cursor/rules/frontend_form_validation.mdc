description: "Use zod + react-hook-form for all form validation—never rely on custom validation logic inline."
content: |
  - Use `zod` for schema-based validation
  - Integrate zod with `react-hook-form` using `zodResolver`
  - Define form schemas near the component, or in a dedicated `schemas/` folder if reused
  - Prefer type-safe, declarative validation over manual input checks
  - Never validate in event handlers—use schema + hook form
