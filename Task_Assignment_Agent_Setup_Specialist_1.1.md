# APM Task Assignment: Project Architecture & Environment Setup

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the AI Headhunter project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent, your core function is to execute specific tasks assigned to you based on our detailed project plan. This involves understanding the requirements provided, performing the necessary actions (e.g., writing code, configuring systems, setting up infrastructure), and meticulously documenting your work.

**Workflow:** You interact directly with the User, who acts as the communication bridge with the Manager Agent. You will report your progress, results, or any issues back to the User, who relays updates to the Manager Agent for review and coordination.

**Memory Bank:** You must log your activities, outputs, and results to the designated Memory Bank file (`Memory/Phase_1_Foundation/Task_1.1_Project_Setup_Log.md`) upon completing tasks or reaching significant milestones, following the standard logging format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Agent_Setup_Specialist: Project Architecture & Environment Setup` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Establish the foundational project structure, configuration, and development environment for the AI Headhunter application.

## 3. Detailed Action Steps

     │       ├── components/
     │       ├── hooks/
     │       ├── types/
     │       └── utils/
     ├── components/
     │   ├── ui/ (for Shadcn components)
     │   └── shared/
     ├── lib/
     │   ├── supabase/
     │   ├── validations/
     │   └── utils/
     ├── hooks/
     └── types/
     ```

2. **Configure TypeScript with strict mode**
   - Update `tsconfig.json` to include strict mode and appropriate compiler options
   - Add path aliases for clean imports (e.g., `@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/features`)
   - Configure proper target and module settings for Next.js App Router compatibility

3. **Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations**
   - Install and configure ESLint with Next.js TypeScript preset
   - Set up Prettier with consistent formatting rules
   - Configure `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` files
   - Add npm scripts for linting and formatting

4. **Configure Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens**
   - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured for the project
   - Set up custom design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` for consistent styling
   - Create base styles and CSS reset in global CSS file
   - Configure proper content paths for Tailwind purging

### Sub-Component 2: Integrate Shadcn UI component library

**Your specific actions are:**

1. **Initialize shadcn/ui with required components**
   - Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` to set up the component library
   - Install the following core components: Form, Input, Button, Card, Select, Label, Textarea
   - Ensure all components are properly configured in `components/ui/` directory

2. **Configure Radix UI primitives for accessible form components**
   - Verify that Radix UI primitives are properly integrated via Shadcn
   - Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation
   - Ensure ARIA attributes are properly configured

3. **Set up component variants and styling tokens**
   - Configure component variants in `tailwind.config.js`
   - Set up consistent styling tokens for colors, spacing, and typography
   - Create utility classes for common design patterns

4. **Create base layout components**
   - Create a main layout component in `src/components/shared/Layout.tsx`
   - Implement proper semantic HTML structure (header, main, footer)
   - Add navigation structure for future resume builder sections

### Sub-Component 3: Set up Supabase backend integration

**Your specific actions are:**

1. **Configure Supabase client with environment variables**
   - Install `@supabase/supabase-js` and required dependencies
   - Create Supabase client configuration in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
   - Set up environment variables in `.env.local` for Supabase URL and anon key
   - Create both client-side and server-side Supabase clients for App Router

2. **Set up authentication context and providers**
   - Create authentication context in `src/lib/supabase/auth-context.tsx`
   - Implement authentication state management using React Context
   - Create authentication provider component
   - Set up session management and token refresh handling

3. **Create database schema for user profiles and resume data storage**
   - Design and create the following tables in Supabase:
     - `profiles` table (user_id, email, full_name, created_at, updated_at)
     - `resumes` table (id, user_id, resume_data JSON, created_at, updated_at)
   - Set up proper foreign key relationships and constraints
   - Create indexes for optimal query performance (user_id, created_at)

4. **Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies**
   - Enable RLS on both profiles and resumes tables
   - Create policies ensuring users can only access their own data
   - Set up policies for authenticated users to CRUD their own records
   - Test RLS policies to ensure proper data protection

### Sub-Component 4: Configure Vercel deployment pipeline

**Your specific actions are:**

1. **Set up environment variables for production deployment**

- Documentation of any environment variables or setup steps required

**Format:** 
- All code should follow TypeScript best practices and ESLint/Prettier formatting
- Database schema should be documented with table structures and relationships
- Environment variable requirements should be clearly documented

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory/Phase_1_Foundation/Task_1.1_Project_Setup_Log.md` file.

- A clear description of the actions taken for each sub-component
- Any key configuration decisions made or challenges encountered
- Code snippets for critical configuration files (tsconfig.json, Supabase client setup, etc.)
