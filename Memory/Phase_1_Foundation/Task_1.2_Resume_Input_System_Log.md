**Agent:** Agent_Frontend_Dev
**Task Reference:** Phase 1, Task 1.2 - Agent_Frontend_Dev: Resume Data Input System

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented a comprehensive resume data input system with TypeScript interfaces, Zod validation schemas, multi-section tabbed form using react-hook-form, and localStorage persistence with auto-save functionality.

**Details:**
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all resume sections (PersonalInfo, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects) in `src/features/resume/types/resume.ts` with proper typing and default values
- Implemented Zod validation schemas in `src/lib/validations/resume-schema.ts` with email/phone/URL validation, date range validation, and character limits
- Built main ResumeForm component with tabbed navigation using Shadcn UI Tabs, form state management via react-hook-form with zodResolver
- Created individual section components: PersonalInfoSection, ExperienceSection, EducationSection, SkillsSection, ProjectsSection
- Implemented dynamic array field management for experience descriptions/achievements, education coursework, project technologies
- Added form persistence utilities with auto-save every 30 seconds, draft recovery, and manual save/load functionality
- Created entry components (ExperienceEntry, EducationEntry, ProjectEntry) with proper field validation and dynamic add/remove functionality
- Implemented skills categorization (technical, soft, certification) with proficiency levels
- Added responsive design with mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
- Created test page at `/resume` to demonstrate functionality

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Key TypeScript interfaces created
export interface ResumeData {
  personalInfo: PersonalInfo;
  experience: Experience[];
  education: Education[];
  skills: Skill[];
  projects: Project[];
}

// Zod validation with custom date range validation
export const resumeDataSchema = z.object({
  personalInfo: personalInfoSchema,
  experience: z.array(experienceSchema).max(10),
  education: z.array(educationSchema).max(5),
  skills: z.array(skillSchema).max(50),
  projects: z.array(projectSchema).max(10),
});
```

**File Structure Created:**
- `src/features/resume/types/resume.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and defaults
- `src/lib/validations/resume-schema.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- `src/features/resume/utils/form-persistence.ts` - localStorage utilities
- `src/features/resume/utils/id-generator.ts` - ID generation utility
- `src/features/resume/components/ResumeForm.tsx` - Main form component
- `src/features/resume/components/PersonalInfoSection.tsx` - Personal info fields
- `src/features/resume/components/ExperienceSection.tsx` - Experience management
- `src/features/resume/components/ExperienceEntry.tsx` - Individual experience entry
- `src/features/resume/components/EducationSection.tsx` - Education management
- `src/features/resume/components/EducationEntry.tsx` - Individual education entry
- `src/features/resume/components/SkillsSection.tsx` - Skills with categorization
- `src/features/resume/components/ProjectsSection.tsx` - Projects management
- `src/features/resume/components/ProjectEntry.tsx` - Individual project entry
- `src/app/resume/page.tsx` - Test page for form

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Encountered TypeScript issues with nested field arrays in react-hook-form. Resolved by using setValue/getValues pattern instead of nested useFieldArray for dynamic description/achievement/coursework/technology arrays. All components now properly typed and functional.

**Next Steps:**
Form system is ready for integration with Supabase backend for data persistence. The structured JSON output is designed to be easily parseable by AI systems for future customization features. Ready to proceed with Task 1.3 - HTML Rendering System.
