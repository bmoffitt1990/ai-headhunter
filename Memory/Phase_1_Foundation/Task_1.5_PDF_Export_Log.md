   - ATS-compliant PDF structure and metadata

2. **Type System** (`src/lib/pdf/types.ts`)
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for PDF configuration
   - Quality presets for different use cases (web, standard, print-ready)
   - Paper size configurations (A4, Letter, Legal)
   - Download tracking and analytics types

3. **API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/generate-pdf/route.ts`)
   - Authenticated PDF generation endpoint
   - Rate limiting (5 requests per minute per user)
   - Request validation and sanitization
   - Proper error handling and HTTP status codes

4. **User Interface Components:**

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Dependencies Added:**
```bash
npm install puppeteer-core @sparticuz/chromium jspdf html2canvas @radix-ui/react-progress
npm install --save-dev @types/puppeteer-core
```

**PDF Generation Flow:**
1. User initiates download through PDFDownload component
2. Request validated and authenticated via API endpoint
3. PDF generator attempts Puppeteer (server-side) first
4. Falls back to jsPDF (client-side) if server-side fails
5. Progress tracked and reported to user interface
6. Generated PDF downloaded with proper filename and metadata

**Quality Presets:**
- **Web Preview:** 96 DPI, high compression, standard quality
- **Standard Application:** 150 DPI, medium compression, high quality
- **Print Ready:** 300 DPI, low compression, print-ready quality, CMYK color

**Security Measures:**
- HTML content sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Rate limiting per authenticated user
- Input validation for all PDF options
- Proper error handling without information leakage

#### Code Examples

**Basic PDF Download Usage:**
```typescript
<PDFDownload
  resumeData={resumeData}
  template={template}
  customizations={customizations}
  options={{ quality: 'high', format: 'A4' }}
  onDownloadComplete={(success, filename) => {
    if (success) {
      console.log(`Downloaded: ${filename}`);
    }
  }}
/>
```

**Advanced Customization:**
```typescript
<PDFCustomization
  options={pdfOptions}
  onChange={(newOptions) => setPdfOptions(newOptions)}
/>
```

**PDF Preview with Download:**
```typescript
<PDFPreviewButton
  resumeData={resumeData}
  template={template}
  customizations={customizations}
  options={{ quality: 'print-ready', dpi: 300 }}
/>
```

#### Performance Metrics

**Generation Times (estimated):**
