**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Agent_Setup_Specialist)
**Task Reference:** Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Agent_Setup_Specialist: Project Architecture & Environment Setup

**Summary:**
Successfully established complete foundational project structure with Next.js App Router, TypeScript strict mode, Shadcn UI integration, Supabase backend configuration, and Vercel deployment pipeline. All sub-components completed and build process verified.

**Details:**
Executed all four sub-components systematically:

1. **Next.js App Router Structure**: Created feature-based directory structure (`src/features/resume/`, `src/components/shared/`, etc.), updated TypeScript configuration with strict mode and comprehensive path aliases, configured ESLint with Prettier integration and custom rules, enhanced Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and animations.

2. **Shadcn UI Integration**: Installed core components (form, input, button, card, select, label, textarea), configured React Hook Form with Zod validation, created utility functions and base layout components with proper semantic HTML structure.

3. **Supabase Backend**: Configured client and server-side Supabase clients with proper SSR support, implemented authentication context with React providers, created comprehensive database schema with profiles and resumes tables, established Row Level Security policies, defined TypeScript interfaces for type-safe database operations.

4. **Vercel Deployment**: Created Vercel configuration with environment variable management, updated Next.js config with performance optimizations, established deployment documentation, tested build process successfully.

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Key configuration files created/updated:

// tsconfig.json - Enhanced with strict mode and path aliases
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
      "@/lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"],
      "@/features/*": ["./src/features/*"],
      "@/hooks/*": ["./src/hooks/*"],
      "@/types/*": ["./src/types/*"]
    }
  }
}

// Database schema (docs/database-schema.sql)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE resumes (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id) NOT NULL,
  resume_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Directory Structure Created:**
```
src/
├── features/resume/{components,hooks,types,utils}/
├── components/{ui,shared}/
├── lib/{supabase,validations,utils}/
├── hooks/
└── types/
```

**Documentation Created:**
- `docs/environment-setup.md` - Supabase configuration guide
- `docs/database-schema.sql` - Complete database setup
- `docs/deployment.md` - Vercel deployment instructions
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive project information

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Encountered build-time error with Supabase client initialization during static generation. Resolved by implementing defensive client creation that handles missing environment variables during build process while maintaining runtime functionality.

**Next Steps:**
Project foundation is complete and ready for Task 1.2 (Resume Input System). All required dependencies installed, configurations established, and build process verified. Environment variables documentation provided for Supabase setup.
